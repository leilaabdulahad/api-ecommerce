## About the Project
This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a backend service for an e-commerce application, allowing users to register, log in, and place orders.

The API supports various endpoints, including user registration and authentication, product management, and order handling. It uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for user authentication and authorization.
